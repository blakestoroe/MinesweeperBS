# MinesweeperBS

minesweeper "clone"
features I want to add/tweak:
1. Preset difficulties
2. collect time to complete level (speedrun/leaderboard purposes)
3. balance controller and game class loads (MVC)
4. set your own custom dimensions/number of bombs
5. tweak colors (borders of cells mostly)
6. fix inefficient algorithms (i.e. counting number of bombs around a cell)
